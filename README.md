# 10-Python SQL toolkit

Section 1
Python and SQLAlchemy were used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) queries, Pandas, JSON's, and Matplotlib were used. SQL tables were reflected into a Jupyter Notebook using SQL Alchemy.

Section 2
A 'Climate App' was designed implementing a Flask API based on the previous queries. Flask was used to create the necessary routes. A resulting analysis was conducted.
